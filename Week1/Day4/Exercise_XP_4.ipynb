    "# Practice working with classes and object interactions by modeling a family and its members.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Create the Person Class\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a Person class with the following attributes:\n",
    "# first_name\n",
    "# age\n",
    "# last_name (string, should be initialized as an empty string)\n",
    "# Add a method called is_18():\n",
    "# It should return True if the person is 18 or older, otherwise False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Create the Family Class\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a Family class with:\n",
    "# A last_name attribute\n",
    "# A members list that will store Person objects (should be initialized as an empty list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a method called born(first_name, age):\n",
    "\n",
    "# It should create a new Person object with the given first name and age.\n",
    "# It should assign the familyâ€™s last name to the person.\n",
    "# It should add this new person to the members list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a method called check_majority(first_name):\n",
    "\n",
    "# It should search the members list for a person with that first_name.\n",
    "# If the person exists, call their is_18() method.\n",
    "# If the person is over 18, print:\n",
    "# \"You are over 18, your parents Jane and John accept that you will go out with your friends\"\n",
    "# Otherwise, print:\n",
    "\n",
    "# \"Sorry, you are not allowed to go out with your friends.\"\n",
    "# Add a method called family_presentation():\n",

    "# Then, it should print each family memberâ€™s first name and age.\n",

    "# Once implemented, your program should allow you to:\n",
